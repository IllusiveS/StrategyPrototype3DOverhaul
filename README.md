# StrategyPrototype3DOverhaul

3d overhaul of turn based strategy game i have on git hub
Main reason for this project was to check how well i did the MVC previously, most of the code was just moved and i added a few new things

Along the line i started toying with delegates events and dependency injection and i regret not doing it sooner. They would make my life much easier    

So now im done with this project, i was able to change it to 3d with no problem whatsoever so i consider it a success
